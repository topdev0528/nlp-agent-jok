# ANAC-agent

Brief installation instructions:

To get two competing agents, clone a copy of this code to two different directories.
In directory #1, rename the *.json.template1 files and configure them appropriately.
In directory #2, rename the *.json.template2 files and configure them appropriately.

Run `npm install` and `crun load` in each directory.

Now there should be two instances of the agents running.
